      <p>To be honest I am looking for any experience I can get in Software Development. This was the longest "Application" I had to fill, but it was the one I enjoyed the most. I am a PhD student but I value my development skills equally which is why I am motivated to polish them.</p>
      <p>Currently my research focuses on analyzing data sharing online. I have a paper published last year as well (link in the CV). My work makes me code alot and hence I have some skills in languages like Python.</p>
